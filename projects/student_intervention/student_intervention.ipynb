    "**Answer: **\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. Decision Tree Classifier\n",
    "A decision tree classifier is typically used when the input features are a mix of both continuous and discrete types as a decision tree classifier can easily handle such type of data. Decision trees are also very easy to interpret and hence are used in applications where it might be useful to know the relative importance of features in classifying a particular input data sample.\n",
    "Strengths\n",
    "Easy to interpret, visualize\n",
    "Similar to how humans make decisions\n",
    "Easily handle discrete/qualitative data types in the features\n",
    "Relatively lower complexity implementation\n",
    "Weaknesses\n",
    "Prone to overfitting\n",
    "High variance, i.e., small changes in the data may result in very different trees\n",
    "Why we choose this model?\n",
    "Based on the given dataset, we observe that almost all the predictors are qualitative. We also observe that the problem is to identify students who might fail to graduate for early intervention. Hence it is important that we have a simple model that can be interpreted easily, i.e., we should be able to easily identify that important predictors responsible for a student success/failure. Therefore, decision tree classifier is an appropriate model for this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2.Support Vector Machine (SVM)\n",
    "SVMs are typically used to model high dimensional data when only a limited amount of data is available for training such as text processing applications like sentiment analysis, document classification etc.\n",
    "Strengths\n",
    "As the SVM classifier uses only the support vectors to do the actual classification, SVMs are memory efficient.\n",
    "A SVM is also robust to some noisy/outlier data points in the dataset as again the classification depends only on a few support vectors. This makes is resistant to overfitting.\n",
    "SVMs can be used for high dimensional datasets where only a limited number of samples are available.\n",
    "Weaknesses\n",
    "Difficult to interpret the model, especially when using non-linear kernels in the SVM.\n",
    "Why we choose this model?\n",
    "As we have many predictors (48), but relatively few observations in our training dataset (300), we choose SVM as a candidate for this problem. One of our objectives is also to use as little data as possible for training the model, hence SVM can be a good candidate for example when using a training set size of 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3.K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) Classifier\n",
    "K-NN is an instance based learning algorithm where the entire training dataset is stored as our model and used to make predictions. The K nearest neighbor datapoints in the training set to the given input sample are identified and their labels are averaged/majority voted to make a prediction/classification. K-NN is very simple to implement and the training phase of a K-NN classifier runs very fast. K-NN's are typically useful in problems where large amounts of data are available.\n",
    "Strengths\n",
    "Simple to implement and easy to understand\n",
    "Performs well when large amounts of data are available\n",
    "Suitable for low dimensional data\n",
    "Weaknesses\n",
    "High complexity when using high dimensional data\n",
    "Why we choose this model?\n",
    "In this problem, we have to predict if a student will fail to graduate or not given some inputs such as school, sex, age etc. It is not far fetched to imagine that students in similar kind of situations, might behave similarly and hence a K-NN classifier can be a valid model for this problem where we can use nearest neighbors from the training data to the given input data vector and classify the input data."

    "With the predefined functions above, you will now import the three supervised learning models of your choice and run the `train_predict` function for each one.

Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",

Note that even though the Decision Tree classifier has $F_1$ scores of 1.0 for the training data sets, this is due to the fact that the decision tree classifier suffers from overfitting. With respect to the complexity of the model implementation, we observe that the decision tree classifier is the one with the least complexity whereas the K-NN model with K = 5 has the highest complexity. Again comparing the prediction times of the SVM and the decision tree classifiers we observe that the time taken by the SVM classifier is not too large when compared to that of the decision tree classifier. With a small dataset such as the one in this problem, SVM is clearly more robust to overfitting and therefore keeping all these observations in mind, we choose the SVM classifier as our best model for the given problem."

    "We have chosen a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier as our model for solving the given problem. The working of a SVM is best demonstrated using an example as shown in the figure below. Suppose we have data points from two classes Class Red and Class Blue as shown and we want to classify them correctly. For such a simple 2-dimensional example, the SVM classifier basically uses the line going through midpoint of the maximum width slab that can be fit in between the two classes. In the example figure, the maximum width slab that can be fit between the two classes is indicated by the dashed lines and its midpoint is the solid line which acts as the classification boundary. The data points closest to the classification boundary are called the support vectors and only these data points directly affect the position of the the classification boundary. Because the classification boundary depends only on a few data points in the training dataset, the SVM classifier is quite robust to the problem of overfitting.\n",
    "When the data are not linearly separable as shown in this simple example, the SVM classifier uses kernels that project the data to higher dimensions and identifies a linear boundary in this higher dimensional space. The training of a SVM classifier is the learning of the decision boundary by formulating and solving an optimization problem. For prediction, we just need to identify if the given data point lies on one side of the boundary or the other which is done using simple arithmetic once the SVM decision boundary coefficients are learned."
